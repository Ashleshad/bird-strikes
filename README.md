Bird Strikes Analysis

A bird strike, also known as a bird-aircraft strike hazard (BASH), occurs when a bird collides with an aircraft. These incidents can happen at any phase of flight, but they are most common during takeoff, landing, and low-altitude flight. Bird strikes pose significant risks to aviation safety, potentially causing damage to the aircraft, engine failures, and, in severe cases, accidents. Measures to mitigate bird strikes include wildlife management at airports, using bird deterrent systems, and designing aircraft engines to withstand bird impacts.
